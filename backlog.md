## Backlog
- Correct distance between tiles which require diagonal and straight movement. Cannot be tested due to all units having only 1 moveCount.
- Producing units in a city places them clockwise around the city. Shall not return positions outside the world. Cannot be tested with only 2 fixed cities.
- Cannot unit test GammaCiv unit action strategies
